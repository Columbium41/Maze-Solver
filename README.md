# Maze Solver (WIP)

# About
A website made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS that allows users to build mazes and solve them with path-searching algorithms. Works on web browsers that support JavaScript and HTML Canvas. 

# What I learned/implemented so far
- Basics of HTML Canvas
- Basics of JavaScript async functions
- Vanilla JavaScript Modules
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Randomized Prim's Algorithm for Maze Generation & Minimum Spanning Trees
- Bidirectional Breadth-First Search & Reversing Linked Lists
- Randomized Depth-First Search for Maze Generation
- Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm for Maze Generation & Disjoint-Set Union Data Structure
- Aldous-Broder Algorithm for Maze Generation
