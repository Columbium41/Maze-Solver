## About 
A web app made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS that allows users to build or generate mazes and solve them with path-finding algorithms. Works on web browsers that support JavaScript and HTML Canvas. App is unsupported by devices with small screens such as smartphones.

## App Features
- Place Maze Objects & Change Maze Size
- Visualize Pathfinding Algorithms
- Visualize Maze Generation Algorithms
- Modify Visualization Speed
